                    <p>    
                        <br>Welcome to my "developer in progress" portfolio. My name is Brenny and I am a 27 year old aspiring full-stack software developer. 
                        I'm a solution-driven creative and visionary, eager to help clients find better ways to improve their business and brand creatively by developing modern, 
                        state-of-the-art software that focuses primarily on the power of minimalism and its ability to get "straight to the point."
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Professionally, I have an extensive background in purchasing, estimating, and project coordination in which I have gained the knowledge and skills to work in a team, solve problems, and get things done. I am who can lead, and be lead.
                        Furthermore, my skills in customer service also help me facilitate and maintain strong client relations, gaurunteeing long-lasting business, and ensuring company growth. Although I currently work in 
                        defense and space as an estimator for circuit boards, I am eager, determined, and hopefule to become a software developer.
